# Predicting the Present
#### By Gabrielle Martinez and Basira Shirzad

## Overview
This project works to replicate and expand on the results of Hyunyoung Choi & Hal Varian's 2011 paper, [Predicting the Present with Google Trends](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2011/ptp.pdf). 

You will see two versions of this project as we had some technical difficulties while working from one document.
