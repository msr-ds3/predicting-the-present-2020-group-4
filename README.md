# Predicting the Present
By Gabrielle Martinez and Basira Shirzad

## Overview
This project works to replicate and expand on the results of Hyunyoung Choi & Hal Varian's 2011 paper, [Predicting the Present with Google Trends](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2011/ptp.pdf). 

You will see two versions of this project as we had some technical difficulties while working from one document.

For our expansion, we tested the paper's model into our present. We wanted to know how well it would do in a time of high uncertainty like the current pandemic, as the paper suggest that in times of strife, a model using trends data is more accurate. 

The finished replication and expansion for *Part 1: Motor vehicles and parts* can be found [here]() and [here]() while the unfinished replication for *Part 2: Unemployment* can be found [here]() and [here]().
